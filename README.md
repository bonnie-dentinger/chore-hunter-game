# chore-hunter-game

Monsters from Monster Hunter (Capcom)

Extremely basic web application that allows our household to make a game out of doing chores. This helps make chores be more fun and allow us to compete for a part of $20 reward each week.

Each chore has an attack power associated with it that indicate difficulty (whether due to length it takes or how much ick factor it includes).
The site displays the damage rankings of each family member and what portion of the money they will receive for their contributions.

Monster total and current health is tracked and displayed for visual reference.

Monster health, chore history, and user damage is reset every Sunday.

TBD:
Make sure Sunday reset works as intended.
No longer allow contributions once monster is defeated.
Grey out monster when defeated.
